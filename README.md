# Vertical sudoku solver in excel

A sudoku solver algorithm implemented using excel function.
No VBA macros were used, only built in functions.
The algorithm is capable of solving vertical sudokus where you don't need to think forward more than 2 steps.

## Usage

Open the excel sheet and put a sudoku puzzle in the first row and columns, the answer will be printed out "on the right".

## Trivia

The font color of the cells containing the functions were set to white color to not be distrubing, but they are on the right of the solver cells (the first 9 columns).
